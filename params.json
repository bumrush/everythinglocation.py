By calling the functions and methods available in _everythinglocation.py_ you can simplify your code and easily access the Address Verification and Geocoding services that **everythinglocation** provides. To learn more about **everythinglocation**, visit their website at [https://www.everythinglocation.com](https://www.everythinglocation.com). **everythinglocation** is a product of [GBG Loqate](http://www.loqate.com).\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: _everythinglocation.py_ is still currently in its development stages. This should not be used for production as this branch is unstable and may produce unexpected results.\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n* Currently able to make Verify requests to the **everythinglocation** API \r\n* Implemented unit tests to upkeep robustness of code now and throughout the development phases\r\n* Search, Geocode, and more coming soon....\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\nInstallation of _everythinglocation.py_ is currently only available by downloading the [source from GitHub](https://github.com/bumrush/everythinglocation.py) and installing it yourself. There are plans to release this packing to the Python Package Index (PyPI) in the near future.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n#### API Key\r\nIn order to use _everythinglocation.py_, you must have an API key. To obtain a key, please visit the [everythinglocation website](https://www.everythinglocation.com) and sign up for an account (your first 100 calls are free).\r\n\r\n_everythinglocation.py_ loads your API key from an environment variable called `EVERYTHINGLOCATION_API_KEY`. If no such environment variable exists, you can assign it like so:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import everythinglocation\r\n>>> everythinglocation.API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'\r\n```\r\n#### Making calls to **everythinglocation**\r\nThe `EverythingLocation()` class takes in a Python dictionary as input to send to the **everythinglocation** service and returns a **ELReponse** object.\r\n```python\r\n>>> import everythinglocation\r\n>>> EL = everythinglocation.EverythingLocation()\r\n>>> print EL.version\r\n2.15.0.7762\r\n>>> params = {'addr': '999 Baker Way San Mateo CA USA'}\r\n>>> response = EL.verify(params)\r\n>>> print response.results[0].AVC\r\nV44-I44-P3-100\r\n>>> print response.results[0].Address1\r\n999 Baker Way\r\n>>> print response.results[0].Address2\r\nSan Mateo CA 94404-1578\r\n>>> print response.results[0].CountryName\r\nUnited States\r\n>>> print response.results[0].ISO3166_2\r\nUS\r\n```\r\nFor more information about input parameters and output fields, please visit the [everythinglocation REST Transactional Processing Documentation](https://www.everythinglocation.com/api-rest-transactional/).\r\n\r\nFuture\r\n------\r\nMore features and documentation coming soon.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
